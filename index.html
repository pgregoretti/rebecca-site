        <span>Why wasn't I moving past my despair?</span>
    </blockquote>
</aside>
          <p class="lead mb-5" align="justify">I did everything "right" in the military. PT leader. Promoted early. Bench marked processes. Deployed. Received multiple medals, awards, kudos, and sterling evaluations. All of it. Likewise, I did everything “right” after separating, too. College degree. Corporate job. Beautiful home. Adoring husband. All of it. Yet, I was struggling emotionally after the military. <i>Why wasn’t my shiny woman veteran status and new civilian life enough?</i>
            <br><br>I got a therapist. I did what a good soldier does: I pushed myself at work and home. And... I pushed myself right to a breakdown, divorce, suicide attempt, and back into my parent’s house, confused. Why was the military easy, and civilian life hard? Therapy validated that some of the things that happened as a woman in and after the military sucked. Being raped, discrimination, PTSD, and isolation are terrible, yeah. But after years of therapy, <i>why wasn’t I moving past my despair?</i>
              <br><br>I decided to try something different. I found a life coach.</p>
                        <aside class="pquote-left">
    <blockquote>
        <span>I found a life coach... my life started to change for the better!</span>
    </blockquote>
</aside>
            <p class="lead mb-5" align="justify">
            The coach gave me tools to handle my shit. I learned to take MEANINGFUL action, not just MORE action. I learned how to truly change and enjoy my life as a veteran. Then, the weirdest thing happened... my life started to change for the better!
            <br><br>I was blown away at how I could deal with my military past and live a happier life in just a few sessions. Knowing that I could a design a future (hell, even HAVE a future) was amazing! I wasn’t on autopilot, or pushing for more. I had a relationship with myself for the first time in my life — and I didn’t have to change my past.
            <br><br>I decided to become a certified life and weight coach for women veterans. I understand all of the unique challenges you’ve faced in and out of the military, because I lived them too, and I came out the other side. I KNOW you can feel better. I know you can be your best self, soon rather than someday.</p>

         <p class="lead mb-5" align="justify">
             I work one-on-one with women veterans who are looking to make your civilian life outstanding, not just ok. In the military we were taught everything from bucking our belts to crisis management. What we weren’t taught was how to create the results we wanted for ourselves.
             <br><br>
             Working together with me is about learning science-based tools to actually improve your life through managing the most powerful tool on earth: your mind. You won't just feel better, you will gain the confidence that you are able to create and grow your best life. My goal is to work together for a shorter span of time where I will teach you to listen to and coach yourself though anything. Really, anything. And it’s fast: we won’t be talking for years about the same incident or feeling. Past clients have:</p>
             <ul class="lead mb-5" id="clients">
            <li>
              Identified and moved past what was holding them back</li>
            <li>
               Healed from trauma</li>
            <li>
              Found peace and purpose</li>
            <li>
              Learned to manage relationships and themselves</li>
          </ul>
             <p class="lead mb-5" align="justify">We will work one-on-one to find out where you are, decide where you want to go, and make a map to get there. My clients are vets who just can’t seem to get civilian life the way they got the military, even though they are smart, capable women. They want to stop projecting being emotionally strong and really be emotionally resilient.</p>
